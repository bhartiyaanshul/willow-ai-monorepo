# üß† WillowAI ‚Äî AI Voice SDR

WillowAI is an open-source, real-time voice SDR (Sales Development Representative) built with Python and React. It acts as a voice-based agent to qualify leads, respond to queries, and hand off conversations to human sales teams when needed.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Backend (Python/FastAPI):**
- Handles all AI, speech, and lead logic.
- `/talk` endpoint: Accepts user messages, returns bot reply, audio, and lead data. Robust error handling and logs all interactions to `interaction.log`.
- `/lead` endpoint: Returns lead summary after conversation ends.
- `stt.py`, `tts.py`, `chatbot.py`: Each module logs transcripts for review and has robust error handling.
- All user and bot messages are logged for audit and debugging.

**Frontend (React):**
- Main chat UI (`App.jsx`) with robust error handling, retry, and transcript logging to `localStorage`.
- Leads dashboard (`Leads.jsx`) for reviewing and deleting saved leads, with error banners.
- All user and bot messages are logged to `localStorage` for recovery and review.
- UI gracefully handles backend interruptions and allows retry.

**Logging & Transcripts:**
- Backend logs all interactions to `interaction.log` and module-specific transcript logs.
- Frontend logs all chat messages to `localStorage` (`willow_transcript`).
- Leads are saved in `localStorage` (`willow_leads`).

unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip -d models/

# Run FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend

## üìù Logging, Error Handling, and Transcript Review

- **Backend:**
  - All user and bot messages, as well as errors, are logged to `backend/interaction.log`.
  - Each module (`stt.py`, `tts.py`, `chatbot.py`) logs transcripts for review.
  - Backend endpoints return user-friendly error messages and handle interruptions gracefully.
- **Frontend:**
  - All chat messages are logged to `localStorage` (`willow_transcript`).
  - Leads are saved in `localStorage` (`willow_leads`).
  - User-friendly error banners are shown for backend or local errors, with retry options.
  - UI recovers from interruptions and allows users to retry failed actions.

## üß© Extending WillowAI

- Add new AI models or swap out TTS/STT engines by editing `backend/tts.py`, `backend/stt.py`, or `backend/chatbot.py`.
- Customize the frontend UI in `frontend/src/App.jsx` and `frontend/src/Leads.jsx`.
- Add new endpoints or business logic in `backend/main.py`.
